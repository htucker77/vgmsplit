*** notes about the source ***

Since this was a personal project, I didn't organize the source very much.
However, since I am releasing the source, I figured I'd at least comment it and
tidy it a bit. Also, it's a good way to get this "pre-release" version of GME
I found in the documentation of foo_gep out into the public.

Speaking of GME, the gme directory contains the unedited files of gme-0.6-pre.
Oddly enough, this can't be found on Blargg's page nor the semi-official Google
Code page for the library. However, this version contains very important code
allowing support for the VRC7 and FDS expansion chips for the NES. Thus, this
version was chosen for my screwing around in coding.

For the curious, the discussion post where I found the library by itself is here:

(While this is a publicly available link, it still has a below-the-table feeling
about the whole business. Maybe someone can clear this out for me?)

Enjoy the chiptune goodness!
